# OpenSighaxInstaller
_A small firmware installer script for GodMode9_

## What is this?
This is a small script that installs `install.firm` from the root of the SD card,
using `install.firm.sha` as a verity file.

## Why did you make this?
I needed it for testing. I figured I should clean it up and make a proper release
of it.

## Usage
Copy the script to `SD:/gm9/scripts/OpenSighaxInstaller.gm9`. Run from GodMode9
script menu.

## Credits
d0k3 for GodMode9
Kitlith for the README format.
